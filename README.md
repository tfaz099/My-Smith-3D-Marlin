# My-Smith-3D-Marlin
For Creality Ender 3 V2 code and binaries
My current Config Files for the Marlin-2.0.x.17 release
The Binary is for the Ender 3 V2 with the 4.2.2 board using a BLTouch with the 5 pin connector.
Babystepping is enabled always which is great for laying down that first layer pressing it into the bed with .01 increments.
